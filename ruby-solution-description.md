# Ruby: AI-Powered Personal Brand Management for CEOs

## The CEO's Dilemma

You have insights worth sharing. You understand your industry deeply. You know thought leadership drives business growth.

But you don't have time to:
- Post daily across 8+ platforms
- Repurpose content into different formats
- Track what's scheduled where
- Maintain consistent brand voice
- Optimize posting times
- Create videos, carousels, and graphics

**The result?** Inconsistent posting. Missed opportunities. A personal brand that doesn't match your expertise.

## Ruby: Your AI Content Operations Manager

Ruby is an AI agent that manages your entire content distribution workflow - from a single long-form video to 40+ pieces of scheduled social content across all platforms.

### What Ruby Does

**1. Multi-Platform Distribution**
- Posts to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Threads, Bluesky, Facebook, Pinterest
- Automatically adapts content for each platform's best practices
- Schedules posts for optimal engagement times
- Tracks everything in a unified schedule

**2. Content Production**
- Generates AI avatar videos (30-second clips from your insights)
- Creates diagrams, infographics, and carousel slides
- Converts horizontal videos to vertical (with captions)
- Manages media uploads and optimization

**3. Brand Voice Consistency**
- Applies your unique tone of voice profiles per platform
- Maintains authenticity across all channels
- Ensures professional quality without sounding robotic

**4. Intelligent Content Sourcing**
- Consumes pre-made content from your repurposing workflow
- Supplements with AI-generated shorts when needed
- Calls your knowledge base for unique perspectives
- Never runs out of content ideas

**5. Newsletter Management**
- Prepares weekly newsletter drafts
- Integrates with Substack
- Coordinates email + social promotion

### The Ruby Workflow

**Your Role:** Record one long-form video per week (30-60 minutes)

**Ruby's Role:**
1. **Scans** your Generated Content folders for repurposed material
2. **Schedules** 40+ posts across platforms over the next week
3. **Generates** supplementary AI video shorts from your knowledge base
4. **Creates** platform-specific graphics and carousels
5. **Uploads** media to temporary hosting (auto-deletes after 30 days)
6. **Posts** content at optimal times for each platform
7. **Tracks** everything in a unified schedule
8. **Maintains** your brand voice across all channels

**Result:** Consistent, high-quality presence across all platforms. You create once, Ruby distributes everywhere.

### Technical Architecture

Ruby integrates with:
- **HeyGen** - AI avatar video generation
- **Creatomate** - Video format conversion and captioning
- **Blotato** - Multi-platform social media API
- **Metricool** - Analytics and performance tracking
- **GoFile** - Temporary media hosting
- **Giphy** - GIF search and management
- **Nano Banana (Gemini)** - Diagram and infographic generation
- **Cornelius** - Your knowledge base agent (provides unique insights)

### Content Strategy Built-In

Ruby follows proven posting frequencies:
- **LinkedIn**: 1/day weekdays, 8am (60% text, 40% video)
- **Twitter**: 6-8/day, staggered throughout day
- **TikTok**: 2/day max (quality over volume)
- **Instagram Reels**: 1/day, 2pm
- **YouTube Shorts**: 1/day, 5pm

Content pillars rotate automatically:
- Industry hot takes & contrarian views
- Technical deep dives and how-to guides
- Founder lessons & entrepreneurship
- Implementation frameworks (prioritized over commentary)
- Trend analysis and insights

### What Makes Ruby Different

**Not a scheduling tool.** Ruby is an AI operations manager that:
- **Thinks strategically** about content distribution
- **Adapts content** for platform-specific best practices
- **Generates supplementary content** when you need it
- **Maintains context** across your entire content ecosystem
- **Learns your voice** through tone of voice profiles
- **Coordinates workflows** across multiple tools and platforms

**Not a generic AI.** Ruby is:
- Purpose-built for CEO personal branding
- Integrated with your knowledge base
- Trained on your specific brand voice
- Coordinated with other specialized AI agents
- Continuously tracking and optimizing

### The CEO Benefit

**Before Ruby:**
- 10-15 hours/week managing social media
- Inconsistent posting schedule
- Content sits unused after creation
- Missing engagement opportunities
- Brand voice varies by platform

**After Ruby:**
- 1 hour/week recording content
- Consistent daily presence across all platforms
- Every piece of content maximized (40+ posts from one video)
- Automated optimal timing
- Unified brand voice everywhere

### ROI: Time & Reach

**Time savings:** 12-14 hours per week
**Content multiplication:** 40x (1 video → 40+ posts)
**Platform reach:** 8+ platforms simultaneously
**Consistency:** 100% (never miss a posting window)
**Quality:** Maintained brand voice across all content

### Implementation

Ruby runs as a Claude Code agent with:
- Custom sub-agents for specialized tasks
- Integration with your existing tools
- Access to your knowledge base
- Platform-specific tone of voice profiles
- Automated workflow orchestration

**Setup time:** 2-4 hours (configure platforms, voice profiles, preferences)
**Maintenance:** Minimal (Ruby self-manages)
**Control:** You approve strategies, Ruby executes

### Beyond Posting

Ruby also:
- Provides analytics insights via Metricool
- Tracks content performance across platforms
- Maintains content inventory and schedules
- Archives published content with metadata
- Identifies content gaps and opportunities

### The Bottom Line

**You focus on:** Creating insights, recording videos, building your business

**Ruby handles:** Everything else - distribution, formatting, scheduling, tracking, optimization, supplementary content generation

**Result:** A personal brand that matches your expertise, without the time investment.
